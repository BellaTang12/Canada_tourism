Tourism is a significant component of Canadian economy. This paper generally investigates the relationship between traveler's total spending in Canada and the characteristics of their trip. By using dataset created by the Canadian 2017 International Travel Survey (ITS), we construct some main variables and create histograms analyzing the distribution of traveler's total spending and trip characteristics such as trip reason, total days, carrier class and entry place. Also, multiple linear regression model haa been built to show the relationship between total spending and trip characteristics. We find that variable trip reason, total days and entry place all are significant predictors to total spending.
